raytracing-tree
===============

An old project of the time that I was an undergraduate student in
Tsinghua Unversity, Beijing. This was one of the final projects of the
course (Introductory) Computer Graphics. The painting is designed and
developed by me (Yucheng Zhang) independently.

The small project depends on OpenCV, but only uses its png-encoding
feature.

'tree.png' is the fancy resulting tree; 'crosses.png' is another picture
made by ray-tracing during I made 'tree.png'.

'raytrace.pdf' is the old report of this project.
